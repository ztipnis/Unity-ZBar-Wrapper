# Unity-ZBar-Wrapper
C++/C code to bridge zbar to Unity

## Not working / Abandonded
The wrapper logic seems sound to me, and builds just fine using CMake (and on macOS
the build script worked fine, not sure about elsewhere), but for  some reason Unity
just wouldn't get any output from the program. I will not be continuing to work on
this, and will therefore not be adding instructions on how to build/use. If anyone
who is familiar with C# & C++ wants to pick this up, feel free.
